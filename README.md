## The Problem

Traditional project management tools have full access to your data. Every card title, every comment, every file—visible to the vendor, vulnerable to breaches, subpoenable by courts.

**Your competitive strategy shouldn't live on someone else's server in plaintext.**

## The Solution

**Think: Chatham House Rule for project management.**

Just like in a Chatham House meeting, the server knows who's in the room — but can't see what's discussed or who said what. Your edits are anonymous, your content is encrypted, your activity is untraceable.

Under the hood: military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption and Semaphore ZK-SNARKs (Groth16 proofs).

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Security Model

![Security Model](docs/images/security-model.png)

### Zero-Knowledge Authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as 👤 Client
    participant S as 🖥️ Server

    Note over C,S: Traditional Auth
    C->>S: "I am Alice"
    S->>C: "Welcome" (server knows you)

    Note over C,S: Chatham (Zero-Knowledge)
    C->>S: ZK Proof: "I'm in the group,<br/>but won't say which member"
    S->>C: "Verified" (server doesn't know who)

    Note over C,S: The server verifies you're authorized WITHOUT learning your identity
```

### Real-time Collaboration Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[👩 Alice offline<br/>📝 Add card 'Design v2']
    B[👨 Bob online<br/>➡️ Move card to 'Done']
    C[👩‍💼 Carol<br/>✏️ Edit card description]

    CRDT[⚡ Automerge CRDT<br/>merges changes automatically]

    Final[✅ FINAL STATE<br/>• Alice's card appears<br/>• Bob's move preserved<br/>• Carol's edit included<br/>• No conflicts!]

## 👁️ The Chatham House Model

**We know you're a paying customer. We cannot know which boards you're in.**

Chatham uses a **decoupled identity architecture** that separates billing from board operations:

![Chatham House Model](docs/images/chatham-house-model.png)

### What The Server Knows

| Email Domain | Commitment Domain |
|--------------|-------------------|
| ✅ Your email | ✅ Board exists |
| ✅ Your tier | ✅ Commitment owns N boards |
| ✅ That you funded a commitment | ✅ Encrypted content |
| ❌ **Which** commitment | ❌ **Whose** commitment |

### What The Server Cannot Link

The server sees two separate facts:
1. `"alice@example.com is a Pro customer"`
2. `"Commitment 0x1a2b owns 3 boards"`

**The server cannot link these facts.** Only your device knows that alice's commitment is 0x1a2b.

### What Other Board Members See

| Data | Visibility | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Your display name | ✅ Visible | You choose it per-board |
| Your avatar color | ✅ Visible | For visual identification |
| Your edits & comments | ✅ Visible | Collaboration requires it |
| Your email | ❌ Hidden | Server doesn't even know |
| Your other boards | ❌ Hidden | Completely separate |

### True Chatham House

Unlike traditional apps, we don't just hide *what* you say — we hide *which rooms you're in*:

<table>
<tr>
<th width="50%">❌ Traditional Apps</th>
<th width="50%">✅ Chatham</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
Server knows:<br/><br/>
• alice@... is in boards X, Y, Z<br/>
• alice@... edited card #123<br/>
• alice@... uploaded file.pdf<br/>
• Complete activity timeline
</td>
<td valign="top">
Server knows:<br/><br/>
• alice@... is a customer<br/>
• "some commitment" has boards<br/>
• "valid member" edited<br/>
• <strong>Cannot link activity to identity</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Bottom line:** We know you exist. We cannot know what you do.

---

## 🔒 Security

### What We Can't Do

- ❌ Read your board contents (encrypted client-side)
- ❌ See what your team discusses (cards, comments, columns)
- ❌ Access your file contents (encrypted before upload)
- ❌ Know who made which specific edit (ZK proofs)
- ❌ Link your email to your boards (decoupled architecture)
- ❌ Reset your password (there is none)
- ❌ Recover your data without your phrase

### What We Can See

- ✅ Your email exists and has a tier (billing only)
- ✅ That boards exist (not whose)
- ✅ That commitments have quotas (not whose)

### What This Means

- ✅ **Content-proof**: Board content is unreadable to us
- ✅ **Membership-anonymous**: Can't link email to boards
- ✅ **Activity-anonymous**: Can't attribute edits to users
- ✅ **You're in control**: Your phrase = your data

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Server compromise | All content encrypted; no email↔board link to steal |
| Man-in-the-middle | TLS + E2EE (double encryption) |
| Malicious insider | Server has no decryption keys, no linkage data |
| Legal compulsion | Can only provide email list; cannot identify board membership |
| Activity tracking | ZK proofs prevent attributing anything to users |
