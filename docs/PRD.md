# Product Requirements Document: ZKKB

**Product Name**: ZKKB (Zero-Knowledge Kanban Board)
**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-11
**Author**: ZKKB Team
**Status**: Accepted

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Existing kanban tools (Trello, Notion, Jira) store user data unencrypted on their servers. This creates privacy risks:
- Service providers can read all board content
- Data breaches expose sensitive project information
- Compliance challenges for regulated industries
- No user control over data access
- Metadata reveals who collaborates with whom

### 1.2 Solution

ZKKB is an end-to-end encrypted kanban board implementing the **Chatham House Model**:

> "We know you're a paying customer. We cannot know which boards you're in or what you do there."

Key properties:
- All content encrypted client-side before transmission
- **Decoupled identity**: Email (billing) is separate from commitment (boards)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for all board operations — no session auth
- Server cannot link your email to your boards
- Real-time collaboration without compromising privacy

### 1.3 The Chatham House Model

Unlike traditional apps where the server knows everything, ZKKB separates identity into two unlinkable domains:

| Email Domain | Commitment Domain |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Authentication | Board operations |
| Billing/tier | Membership proofs |
| Storage quota | Board ownership |
| Server links: email ↔ tier | Server links: commitment ↔ boards |
| **No link between domains** | **Only client knows both** |

See [ADR-006](adr/006-decoupled-identity-architecture.md) for technical details.

### 1.4 Target Users

| Segment | Description | Pain Point |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Privacy-conscious developers | Solo devs, open source maintainers | Don't trust SaaS with project plans |
| Security teams | InfoSec, red teams, bug bounty hunters | Need encrypted comms for findings |
| Legal/Compliance | Law firms, healthcare | Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) |
| Journalists/Activists | Investigative reporters, NGOs | Adversarial threat model |

### 1.5 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target (6 months) | Target (12 months) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Free to Pro conversion | 2% | 4% |
| DAU/MAU ratio | 30% | 40% |
| NPS score | 40 | 50 |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Authentication & Identity

ZKKB uses a **decoupled identity model** where email authentication and board operations are completely separate.

#### 4.1.1 Signup Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant E as Extension
    participant S as Server

    Note over U,S: EMAIL DOMAIN (one-time)
    U->>E: Enter email
    E->>S: POST /auth/send-code
    S->>U: Email with 6-digit code
    U->>E: Enter code
    E->>S: POST /auth/verify
    S->>E: Session token + tier info

    Note over U,E: CLIENT-SIDE (never leaves device)
    E->>E: Generate recovery phrase
    E->>E: Derive commitment from phrase

    Note over E,S: FUNDING (one-time link moment)
    E->>S: POST /commitment/fund
    S->>S: Grant quota to commitment
    S->>S: Increment user.funded_count
    S->>S: NO permanent link stored

    Note over U,S: From now on: ZK proofs only
    E->>U: Display phrase (save it!)
```

#### 4.1.2 Board Operations (Post-Signup)

All board operations use ZK proofs — **email/session never involved**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Extension
    participant S as Server

    E->>E: Generate ZK proof
    E->>S: POST /boards (+ ZK proof)
    S->>S: Verify proof
    S->>S: Check commitment quota
    S->>E: Board created
```

### 7.2 Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Protection |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Board content | Confidential | AES-256-GCM encrypted |
| Recovery phrase | Secret | Never transmitted, user custody |
| Private keys | Secret | IndexedDB, never transmitted |
| Email addresses | PII | D1, not linked to boards |
| Merkle trees | Internal | Public commitments only |

### 7.3 Server Knowledge Matrix (Decoupled Architecture)

#### Email Domain

| Data | Server Knows | Server Cannot Know |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Email address | ✅ Yes | — |
| Tier (free/pro) | ✅ Yes | — |
| Funded commitment count | ✅ Yes (e.g., "1") | Which commitment |
| Payment info | ✅ Yes | — |

#### Commitment Domain

| Data | Server Knows | Server Cannot Know |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Board exists | ✅ Yes (board ID) | Board name, content |
| Creator | ✅ Commitment | Whose commitment |
| Members | ✅ Merkle tree | Who they are |
| Activity | ✅ That sync happened | Which member |
| Board count | ✅ Per commitment | Whose commitment |
| Storage used | ✅ Per commitment | Whose commitment |

#### The Privacy Guarantee

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Server sees TWO separate facts:                                │
│                                                                  │
│  1. "alice@example.com is a Pro customer"                       │
│  2. "Commitment 0x1a2b owns 3 boards"                           │
│                                                                  │
│  Server CANNOT link these facts.                                │
│  Only the client knows: alice's commitment is 0x1a2b            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**True Chatham House**: We know you're a paying customer. We cannot know which rooms you're in.
