# Product Requirements Document: ZKKB

**Product Name**: ZKKB (Zero-Knowledge Kanban Board)
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-10
**Author**: ZKKB Team
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Existing kanban tools (Trello, Notion, Jira) store user data unencrypted on their servers. This creates privacy risks:
- Service providers can read all board content
- Data breaches expose sensitive project information
- Compliance challenges for regulated industries
- No user control over data access

### 1.2 Solution

ZKKB is an end-to-end encrypted kanban board where:
- All content is encrypted client-side before transmission
- Zero-knowledge proofs anonymize *which member* made *which edit* (activity anonymity)
- Users control their keys via a 24-word recovery phrase
- Real-time collaboration works without compromising content privacy

**Note**: The server knows who is a member (via email), but cannot see board content or attribute edits to specific members.

### 1.3 Target Users

| Segment | Description | Pain Point |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Privacy-conscious developers | Solo devs, open source maintainers | Don't trust SaaS with project plans |
| Security teams | InfoSec, red teams, bug bounty hunters | Need encrypted comms for findings |
| Legal/Compliance | Law firms, healthcare | Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) |
| Journalists/Activists | Investigative reporters, NGOs | Adversarial threat model |

### 1.4 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target (6 months) | Target (12 months) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Monthly Active Users | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Free to Pro conversion | 2% | 4% |
| DAU/MAU ratio | 30% | 40% |
| NPS score | 40 | 50 |

## 7. Security Model

### 7.1 Threat Model

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Threats
        T1[Server Compromise]
        T2[MITM Attack]
        T3[Device Theft]
        T4[Malicious Member]
        T5[Brute Force]
    end

    subgraph Mitigations
        M1[E2EE - Server sees ciphertext only]
        M2[TLS 1.3 everywhere]
        M3[IndexedDB + browser password]
        M4[Re-key on member removal]
        M5[Rate limiting + code expiry]
    end

    T1 --> M1
    T2 --> M2
    T3 --> M3
    T4 --> M4
    T5 --> M5
```

### 7.2 Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Protection |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Board content | Confidential | AES-256-GCM encrypted |
| Recovery phrase | Secret | Never transmitted, user custody |
| Private keys | Secret | IndexedDB, never transmitted |
| Email addresses | PII | D1, not linked to boards |
| Merkle trees | Internal | Public commitments only |

### 7.3 Server Knowledge Matrix

| Data | Server Can See | Server Cannot See |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Board existence | Board ID | Board name, content |
| Membership | Email → Board mapping | N/A (server knows members) |
| Activity | That sync happened | Which member made which edit |
| Attachments | Encrypted size | Content, filename |

**Clarification**: The server knows *who* is a member (via `user_boards` table and email auth). ZK proofs anonymize *activity*, not membership. This is the "Chatham House" model: we know who's in the room, but not who said what.
